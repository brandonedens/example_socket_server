Introduction
------------

The following software is an example socket server utilizing epoll and a
threaded work queue system for servicing incoming events. In addition the
server can be reloaded by sending SIGUSR2 signals to the process which will
trigger a reload of the software.

Compilation
-----------

This project uses the link:https://github.com/jpakkane/meson[meson build
system] for compilation. To build the project with Meson create a build
directory and instruct meson to setup the build directory via:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build
$ meson . build
----

Then run ninja to compile the software.

[source,bash]
----
$ ninja -C build
----

If all goes well you should have an executable in your build directory named
"example-server".

Execution
---------

Start the server via ./example-server and then utilize telnet or netcat to
connect to it on port 3939.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./build/example_server
----

[source,bash]
----
$ telnet localhost 3939
----

As a performance test try feeding continuous data to the server.

[source,bash]
----
$ nc localhost 3939 < /dev/zero
----
